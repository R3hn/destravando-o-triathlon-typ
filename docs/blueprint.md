## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Pure black (#000000) to create a dark and impactful feel.
- Primary color: Neon red (#FF0033) for highlights, CTAs, and the main title to capture attention. Based on the user's prompt, neon red should be used as the highlight color, signifying action and excitement.
- Accent color: Light grey (#D3D3D3) for microcopy and secondary text elements, providing contrast against the dark background and ensuring legibility. Derived from the prompt to keep white and clear-grey colors for the texts.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern and legible look in both titles and body text. This font mirrors the style of the page of capture that was shared in the prompt.
- Use simple, outline neon icons for visual elements, such as a WhatsApp icon on the CTA button. The background should be dark circular.
- Centralized layout with visually separated blocks and generous spacing for easy content consumption, as per the design brief in the user's prompt.
